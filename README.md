## Project Description
Pokemon is a popular Japanese animation franchise created in 1996. It was first developed as a video game and soon adapted into various forms of media, including anime television and film series. The animation attracts people from all over the world, which also further extends to video games and other side-line products. Because of the fact that the popularity of this animation never fades out, there has been massive relevant information and data available for the audience to digest. For example, each Pokemon character itself contains plenty of strength-based statistics, including the time, body dimension, etc. Side-line products of this animation come along with much data of quantitative outcomes such as box office revenues. In addition, there appears to be no publicly available visualization that summarizes all the information very comprehensively. Therefore, given these facts, our project aims to organize different and unstructured resources into visually appealing pages that provide the Pokemon audience with a central hub of aggregating and exploring Pokemon related information.
